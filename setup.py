# The following code may be very specific to my own home configuration,
# although I hope that it's useful to other who try to create PyVISA packages,
# too.
#
# The goal is to override an existing local RPM configuration.  Distutils only
# works together with a widely untouched configuration, so I have to disable
# any extisting one represented by the file ~/.rpmmacros.  I look for this file
# and move it to ~/.rpmmacros.original.  After setup.py is terminated, this
# renaming is reverted.
#
# Additionally, if a file ~/.rpmmacros.distutis exists, it is used for
# ~/.rpmmacros while setup.py is running.  So you can still make use of things
# like "%vendor" or "%packager".

# want to overwrite it, and secondly, I don't want this renaming to take place
# twice.  This would happen otherwise, because setup.py is called more than
# once per building session.
