:Abstract: This document covers the ``vpp43.py`` module, which is part of the
  PyVISA_ package.  This module implements thin wrappers around all functions
  defined in the `VISA specification`_.  Thus it enables the programmer to
  communicate with measurement and test devices via GPIB, RS232, USB etc.

Overview
========

The programming of measurement instruments can be real pain.  There are many
different protocols, sent over many different interface and bus systems.  For
every programming language you want to use, you have to find libraries that
support both your device and its bus system.

In order to ease this unfortunate situation, the VISA [#]_ specification was
defined in the middle of the 90ies.  Today VISA is implemented on all
significant operating systems.  A couple of vendors offer VISA libraries,
albeit mostly in binary form.  These libraries work together with arbitrary
peripherical devices, although they may be limited to certain interface
devices, such as the vendor's GPIB card.

.. [#] Virtual Instrument Software Architecture

The VISA specification has explicit bindings to Visual Basic, C, and G
(LabVIEW's graphical language).  However, you can use VISA with any language
capable of calling functions in a DLL.  Python is such a language.


VISA and Python
===============

Python has a couple of features that make it very interesting for measurement
controlling:

* Python is an easy-to-learn scripting language with short development cycles.

* It represents a high abstraction level [#]_, which perfectly blends with the
  abstraction level of measurement programs.

* It has a very rich set of native libraries, including numerical and plotting
  modules for data analysis and visualisation.

* A large set of books (in many languages) and on-line publications is
  available.

* You can download it for free at http://www.python.org.

.. [#] For example, you don't need to care about the underlying operating
       system with all its peculiarities.

The PyVISA package is a VISA binding for Python.  It is implemented in two
layers.  This document describes its lower level ``vpp43.py``, which directly
accesses the VISA functions from Python.  On top of it, an object-oriented
Python module has been created called ``visa.py``.  In case of doubt, use
``visa.py`` because it is easier and more convenient. ``vpp43.py`` is only for
people who need full control or the official VISA functions for some reason.


About the vpp43 module
......................

This module ``vpp43`` is a cautious yet thorough adaption of the VISA
specification for Python.  The "textual languages" VISA specification can't be
implemented as is because Python is rather different from C and Visual Basic,
most notably because of lacking call-by-reference.  The second important
difference are strings: In C they are null-terminated whereas Python doesn't
have this constraint.

The slightly odd name ``vpp43`` for this module derives from the necessity to
make (name)space for the ``visa`` module that is supposed to realise the actual
high-level VISA access in Python.  The `VXIplug&play Systems Alliance`_ used to
maintain the VISA specifications, and, although today the `IVI foundation`_ is
responsible for this task, the files are still called ``vpp43.doc`` etc.  So I
thought ``vpp43`` was a catchy name.

.. _`VXIplug&play Systems Alliance`: http://www.vxipnp.org/
.. _`IVI foundation`: http://ivifoundation.org

You may wonder why I did choose new names for all routines.  I did so because
Python has its own naming guidelines, and because it shows that the routines
had to be adapted.  However, I didn't change them really: Every routine is a
1:1 counterpart.  By calling them from C, you could even create a C-based VISA
implementation with the original function signatures and semantics.  Moreover,
the new names are mere expansions of the original ones.


Prerequisites
=============

The PyVISA package doesn't include a VISA library itself.  You have to download
it from one of the VISA vendors, e.g. `National Instruments' VISA pages`_.
Please install it properly before you proceed.

.. _`National Instruments' VISA pages`: http://ni.com/visa/

Additionally, your Python installation needs a fresh version of `ctypes`_.  By
the way, if you use Windows, it may be convenient to install
`Enthought-Python`_.  It is a special Python version with all-included
philosophy for scientific and engineering applications. [#]_

.. _`ctypes`: http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/
.. _`Enthought-Python`: http://www.enthought.com/python/
.. [#] Of course, it's highly advisable not to have installed another version
       of Python on your system before you install Enthought-Python.

Setting up the module
=====================

Windows
.......

PyVISA expects a file called ``visa32.dll`` in the PATH.  You must assure that
this is the case.  For example, on my system you find this file in
``C:\WINNT\system32\``.  Either copy it there or expand your PATH.


Linux
.....

For Linux, the default VISA library is
``/usr/local/vxipnp/linux/bin/libvisa.so.7``.  However, here you have the
choice.  If it's called differently on your system, or is placed in another
directory, you can tell PyVISA so by saying::

    from vpp43 import *

    visa_library.load_library("/usr/local/visa/libvisa.so.7")

Of course, you must set the path according to your installation.  You must do
this before any VISA function call.


Diagnostics
===========

This module can raise two ``vpp43``-specific exceptions.  They are defined in
the ``visa_exceptions`` module.

:Name: VisaIOError
:Description: This is an error of the underlying VISA library, as described in
    table 3.3.1 in the `VISA specification for textual languages`_.  The
    exception member ``error_code`` contains the (always negative) VISA error
    number, as listed in that table.

.. _`VISA specification for textual languages`:
       http://www.ivifoundation.org/Downloads/Class%20Specifications/vpp432.doc

:Name: VisaTypeError
:Description: The current implementation of `printf`_, `scanf`_, `sprintf`_,
    `sscanf`_, and `queryf`_ have the limitation that only integers, floats,
    and strings are allowed as types for the arbitrary arguments.
    Additionally, only format string directives for C longs, C doubles, and C
    strings are allowed to use, albeit not checked.  However, if you pass a
    list or a unicode string, you get this exception.

Moreover, this module may pass exceptions generated by ctypes.  This may be
because you've passed a wrong type to a function, or that the VISA library file
was not found, but it may also mean a bug in ``vpp43`` itself.  So if you don't
see why the exception was raised, contact the current maintainers of PyVISA.


The PyVISA function reference
=============================

Please note that all descriptions given in this reference serve mostly as
reminder.  For real descriptions consult a `VISA specification`_ or `NI-VISA
Programmer Reference Manual`_.  However, whenever there are PyVISA-specific
semantics, they are listed here, too.

       | value_16 = in_16(vi, space, offset)
       | value_32 = in_32(vi, space, offset)
:VISA name: viIn8, viIn16, viIn32
:Parameters:
    `vi` : ViSession
        Unique logical identifier to a session.
    `space` : integer
        Specifies the address space.
    `offset` : integer
        Offset in bytes of the address or register from which to read.
:Return values:
    `value_8`, `value_16`, `value_32` : integer
        Data read from bus (8 bits for `in_8`, 16 bits for `in_16`, and 32
        bits for `in_32`).


install_handler
...............

Install handlers for event callbacks.

:Call: install_handler(vi, event_type, handler, user_handle)
:VISA name: viInstallHandler
:Parameters:
    `vi` : ViSession
        Unique logical identifier to a session.
    `event_type` : integer
        Logical event identifier.
    `handler` : callable
        Interpreted as a valid reference to a handler to be installed by a
        client application.
    `user_handle` : ``None``, float, integer, string, or list of floats or integers : optional
        A value specified by an application that can be used for identifying
        handlers uniquely for an event type.  It defaults to ``None``.
:Return values:
    `converted_user_handle` : ctypes type
        An object representing the user_handle.  Use it to communicate with
	your handler.  If your user_handle was a list, you get its elements as
	usual with ``converted_user_handle[index]``.  You can even convert it
	to a list with ``list(converted_user_handle)`` (however, this yields a
	copy).

        For strings, use ``converted_user_handle.value`` if it's supposed to be
        interpreted as a null-terminated string, or
        ``converted_user_handle.raw`` if you want to see *all* bytes.  You can
        also write to both expressions, however, slicing is only possible for
        reading.

        For simple types, you can say ``converted_user_handle.value`` (read and
        write).

        You must assure that never values are written to converted_user_data
        which are longer (in bytes) than the original values.  So be careful
        not to write a string longer than the original one, or an longer list.


lock
....

Establish an access mode to the specified resource.

:Call: access_key = lock(vi, lock_type, timeout, requested_key)
:VISA name: viLock
:Parameters:
    `vi` : ViSession
        Unique logical identifier to a session.
    `lock_type` : integer
        Specifies the type of lock requested, which can be either
        ``VI_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK`` or ``VI_SHARED_LOCK``.
    `timeout` : integer
        Absolute time period in milliseconds that a resource waits to get
        unlocked by the locking session before returning this operation with an
        error.
    `requested_key` : string : optional
        This parameter is not used if `lock_type` is ``VI_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK``
        (exclusive locks).  When trying to lock the resource as
        ``VI_SHARED_LOCK`` (shared), you can either omit it so that VISA
        generates an `access_key` for the session, or you can suggest an
        `access_key` to use for the shared lock.
:Return values:
    `access_key` : string : optional
        This value is ``None`` if `lock_type` is ``VI_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK``
        (exclusive locks).  When trying to lock the resource as
        ``VI_SHARED_LOCK`` (shared), the function returns a unique access key
        for the lock if the operation succeeds.  This `access_key` can then be
        passed to other sessions to share the lock.


map_address
...........

Map the specified memory space into the process's address space.

:Call: address = map_address(vi, map_space, map_base, map_size, access,
       suggested)
:VISA name: viMapAddress

        Offset in bytes of the memory to be mapped.
    `map_size` : integer
        Amount of memory to map in bytes.
    `access` : integer : optional
        Must be ``VI_FALSE``.
    `suggested` : integer : optional
        If not ``VI_NULL`` (the default), the operating system attempts to map
        the memory to the address specified in suggested. There is no
        guarantee, however, that the memory will be mapped to that
        address. This operation may map the memory into an address region
        different from suggested.
:Return values:
    `address` : ViAddr
        Address in your process space where the memory was mapped.


map_trigger
...........

        fields are as defined by the USB specification.  The direction bit must
        be host-to-device.
    `request_id` : integer
        Request ID for this transfer.  The meaning of this value depends on
        `request_type_bitmap_field`.
    `request_value` : integer
        Request value for this transfer.
    `index` : integer
        Specifies the interface or endpoint index number, depending on
        `request_type_bitmap_field`.
    `buffer` : string : optional
        Actual data to send to the device during the Data stage.  If not given,
        nothing is sent.
:Return values:
    None.


vprintf, vqueryf, vscanf, vsprintf, vsscanf
...........................................

These variants make no sense in Python, so I realised them as mere aliases
(just drop the "v").


vxi_command_query
.................

Send the device a miscellaneous command or query and/or retrieve the response
to a previous query.

:Call: vxi_command_query(vi, mode, command)
:VISA name: viVxiCommandQuery
:Parameters:
    `vi` : ViSession
        Unique logical identifier to a session.
    `mode` : integer
        Specifies whether to issue a command and/or retrieve a response.
    `command` : integer
        The miscellaneous command to send.
:Return values:
    `response` : integer
        The response retrieved from the device.  If the mode specifies just
	sending a command, this parameter may be ``VI_NULL``.


wait_on_event
.............

Wait for an occurrence of the specified event for a given session.

:Call: out_event_type, out_context = wait_on_event(vi, in_event_type, timeout)
:VISA name: viWaitOnEvent
:Parameters:
    `vi` : ViSession
        Unique logical identifier to a session.
    `in_event_type` : integer
        Logical identifier of the event(s) to wait for.
    `timeout` : integer
        Absolute time period in milliseconds that the resource shall wait for a
        specified event to occur before returning the time elapsed error.
:Return values:
    `out_event_type` : integer
        Logical identifier of the event actually received.
    `out_context` : ViEvent
        A handle specifying the unique occurrence of an event.


write
.....

Write data to device synchronously.

:Call: return_count = write(vi, buffer)
:VISA name: viWrite
:Parameters:
    `vi` : ViSession
        Unique logical identifier to a session.
    `buffer` : string
        Contains the data block to be sent to the device.
:Return values:
    `return_count` : integer
        The number of bytes actually transferred.


write_asynchronously
....................

Write data to device asynchronously.

:Call: job_id = write_asynchronously(vi, buffer)
:VISA name: viWriteAsync
:Parameters:
    `vi` : ViSession
        Unique logical identifier to a session.
    `buffer` : string
        Contains the data block to be sent to the device.
:Return values:
    `job_id` : ViJobId
        The job identifier of this asynchronous write operation.


write_from_file
...............

Take data from a file and write it out synchronously.

:Call: return_count = write_from_file(vi, filename, count)
:VISA name: viWriteFromFile
:Parameters:
    `vi` : ViSession
        Unique logical identifier to a session.
    `filename` : string
        Name of file from which data will be read.
    `count` : integer
        Maximal number of bytes to be written.
:Return values:
    `return_count` : integer
        Number of bytes actually transferred.
