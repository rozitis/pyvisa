The VISA low-level implementation

:Abstract: This document covers the ``vpp43.py`` module, which is part of the
  pyvisa_ package.  This module implements thin wrappers around all functions
  defined in the VISA specification.  Thus it enables the programmer to
  communicate with measurement and test devices via GPIB, RS232, USB etc.

Overview
===========

The programming of measurement instruments can be real pain.  There are many
different protocols, sent over many different interface and bus systems.  For
every programming language you want to use, you have to find libraries that
support both your device and its bus system.

In order to ease this unfortunate situation, the VISA [#]_ specification was
defined in the middle of the 90ies.  Today VISA is implemented on all
significant operating systems.  Many vendors offer VISA libraries, albeit
mostly in binary form.  A VISA library works together with arbitrary
peripherical devices, although it may be limited to certain interface devices,
such as the vendor's GPIB card.

The VISA specification has explicit bindings to Visual Basic, C, and G
(LabVIEW's graphical language).  However, you can use VISA from any language
capable of calling functions in a DLL.  Python is such a language.


VISA and Python
====================

Python has a couple of features that make it very interesting for measurement
controlling:

* Python is an easy-to-learn scripting language with short development cycles.

* A large set of books (in many languages) and on-line publications is
  available.

* It represents a high abstraction level [#]_, which perfectly blends with the
  abstraction level of measurement programs.

* It has a very rich set of native libraries, including numerical and plotting
  modules for data analysis and visualisation.

* You can download it for free at http://www.python.org.

.. [#] For example, you don't need to care about the underlying operating
       system with all its peculiarities.

The pyvisa package is a VISA binding for Python.  It is implemented in two
layers.  This document describes its lower level ``vpp43.py``, which directly
accesses the VISA functions from Python.  On top of it, an object-oriented
Python module has been created called ``visa.py``.  In case of doubt, use
``visa.py`` because it is easier and more convenient. ``vpp43.py`` is only for
people who need full control or the official VISA functions for some reason.


Prerequisites
================

The pyvisa package doesn't include a VISA library itself.  You have to download
it from one of the VISA vendors, e.g. `National Instruments' VISA pages`_.
