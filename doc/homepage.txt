Overview
========

The programming of measurement instruments can be real pain.  There are many
different protocols, sent over many different interface and bus systems.  For
every programming language you want to use, you have to find libraries that
support both your device and its bus system.

In order to ease this unfortunate situation, the VISA [#]_ specification was
defined in the middle of the 90ies.  Today VISA is implemented on all
significant operating systems.  A couple of vendors offer VISA libraries,
albeit mostly in binary form.  These libraries work together with arbitrary
peripherical devices, although they may be limited to certain interface
devices, such as the vendor's GPIB card.

.. [#] Virtual Instrument Software Architecture

The VISA specification has explicit bindings to Visual Basic, C, and G
(LabVIEW's graphical language).  However, you can use VISA with any language
capable of calling functions in a DLL.  Python is such a language.


VISA and Python
===============

Python has a couple of features that make it very interesting for measurement
controlling:

* Python is an easy-to-learn scripting language with short development cycles.

* It represents a high abstraction level [#]_, which perfectly blends with the
  abstraction level of measurement programs.

* It has a very rich set of native libraries, including numerical and plotting
  modules for data analysis and visualisation.

* A large set of books (in many languages) and on-line publications is
  available.

* You can download it for free at http://www.python.org.

.. [#] For example, you don't need to care about the underlying operating
       system with all its peculiarities.

PyVISA
=======

The PyVISA package is a VISA binding for Python.  It is implemented in two
layers:

1. First, there is the lower level ``vpp43``, which directly accesses the VISA
   functions from Python.  See the `PyVISA low-level implementation`_ for more
   information.

2. On top of it, an object-oriented Python module has been created called
   ``pyvisa``.  In case of doubt, use ``pyvisa`` because it is easier and more
   convenient. ``vpp43`` is only for people who need full control or the
   official VISA functions for some reason.  See the `PyVISA manual`_ for more
   information.

The `PyVISA project page`_ contains the bug tracker and the download area.
