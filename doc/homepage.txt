PyVISA
=======

The PyVISA package enables you to control all kinds of measurement equipment
through various buses (GPIB, RS232, USB) with Python programs.  As an example,
reading self-identification from a Keithley Multimeter with GPIB number 12
is as easy as three lines of Python code::

    import visa
    keithley = visa.instrument("GPIB::12")
    print keithley.ask("*IDN?")

(That's the whole program; really!) It is tailored to work on both Windows and
Linux, and with arbitrary adapters (e.g. National Instruments, Agilent,
Tektronics).  In order to achieve this, PyVISA relies on an external library
file which is bundled with hardware and software of those vendors.  (So only in
rare cases you have to purchase it separately.)

PyVISA implements convenient and Pythonic programming in two layers:

1. An object-oriented Python module has been created simply called ``visa``.
   It is the recommended way to use PyVISA.  See the `PyVISA manual`_ for more
   information.

2. Additionally, there is the lower level module ``vpp43``, which directly
   calls the VISA functions from Python.  See the `PyVISA low-level
   implementation`_ for more information.  ``vpp43`` is only for people who
   need full control or the official VISA functions for some reason.

PyVISA is free open-source software.  The `PyVISA project page`_ contains the
bug tracker and the download area.

Projects using PyVISA so far:

* `pyvLab`_ -- program to control VISA-talking instruments

General overview
================

The programming of measurement instruments can be real pain.  There are many
different protocols, sent over many different interfaces and bus systems (GPIB,
RS232, USB).  For every programming language you want to use, you have to find
libraries that support both your device and its bus system.

In order to ease this unfortunate situation, the VISA [#]_ specification was
defined in the middle of the 90ies.  Today VISA is implemented on all
significant operating systems.  A couple of vendors offer VISA libraries,
albeit mostly chargeable.  These libraries work together with arbitrary
peripherical devices, although they may be limited to certain interface
devices, such as the vendor's GPIB card.

.. [#] Virtual Instrument Software Architecture

The VISA specification has explicit bindings to Visual Basic, C, and G
(LabVIEW's graphical language).  However, you can use VISA with any language
capable of calling functions in a DLL.  Python is such a language.


VISA and Python
===============

Python has a couple of features that make it very interesting for measurement
controlling:

* Python is an easy-to-learn scripting language with short development cycles.

* It represents a high abstraction level [#]_, which perfectly blends with the
  abstraction level of measurement programs.

* It has a very rich set of native libraries, including numerical and plotting
  modules for data analysis and visualisation.

* A large set of books (in many languages) and on-line publications is
  available.

* You can download it for free at http://www.python.org.

.. [#] For example, you don't need to care about the underlying operating
       system with all its peculiarities.
